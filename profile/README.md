**The Edgeberry project adapts the Raspberry Pi for the challenges of the IoT edge**. 
Edgeberry is an open-source ecosystem that enhances your favorite single-board computer with hardware, software and mechanical 
features for optimizing its usability as an IoT device - making it easier to explore the connected device component in your 
unique solutions. Aimed at fast and lean develop-and-deploy iterations, Edgeberry simplifies the process of bridging the 
physical world with the digital realm.

- The **Baseboard** is the hardware component that connects all Edgeberry's components to the Raspberry Pi, providing it with a robust power supply, status indicators and a unique identifier for cloud connectivity.
- The **Enclosure** shields the system from real-world environmental challenges.
- The **Hardware Cartridges** are the application-specific hardware modules, with a design template available in KiCad EDA.
- The **Device Hub** is the bridge, connecting the real-world devices with the cloud applications

Edgeberry is fully **open-source**, leveraging open platforms like Raspberry Pi and GNU/Linux and designed with open tools such as KiCad EDA and FreeCAD, embodying the ethos of freedom and democratizing IoT technology.
